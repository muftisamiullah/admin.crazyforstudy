The players are allowed to communicate before the game begins to decide on
a strategy. However, no communication is permitted after the game begins. Players
cannot see their own hats. But each player can see the other two players’ hats. Each
player is given the option to guess the color of his or her hat or to pass. The game
ends when the three players simultaneously make their choices. The team wins if
no player’s guess is incorrect and at least one player’s guess is correct. Obviously,
the team’s goal is to develop a strategy that maximizes the probability of winning.

Hint: Let H, H1, and H2 denote the events that the mother, the first son, and the second son are hemophilic, respectively. Note that H1 and H2 are conditionally independent given H. That is, if we are given that the mother is hemophilic, knowledge about one son being hemophilic does not change the chance of the other son being hemophilic. However, H1 and H2 are not independent. This is because if we know that one son is hemophilic, the mother is hemophilic and therefore with

,,,,,15EB,"(Laplace’s Law of Succession) Suppose that n + 1 urns are numbered 0 through n, and the ith urn contains i red and n ? i white balls, 0 ? i ? n. An urn is selected at random, and then the balls it contains are removed one by one, at random, and with replacement. If the first m balls are all red, what is the probability that the (m + 1)st ball is also red? Hint: Let Ui be the event that the ith urn is selected, Rm the event that the first m balls drawn are all red, and R the event that the (m + 1)st ball drawn is red. Note that R and Rm are conditionally independent given Ui; that is, given that the ith urn is selected, R and Rm are independent. Hence P(R | RmUi) = P(R | Ui) = i n. To find P(R | Rm), use P(R | Rm) = n i=0 P(R | RmUi)P(Ui | Rm), where P(Ui | Rm) is obtained from Bayes’ theorem. The final answer is P(R | Rm) = n i=0  i n m+1 n k=0 k n m . Note that if we consider the function f(x) = xm+1 on the interval [0, 1], the right Riemann sum of this function on the partition 0 = x0 < x1 < x2 < ··· < xn = 1, xi = i/n is n i=1 f(xi)(xi ? xi?1) = n i=1 xm+1 i 1 n = 1 n n i=0  i n m+1 . Therefore, for large n, (1/n) n i=0(i/n)m+1 is approximately equal to  1 0 xm+1dx = 1/(m+2). Similarly, (1/n) n k=0(k/n)m is approximately  1 0 xmdx = 1/(m+1). Hence P(R | Rm) = 1 n n i=0  i n m+1 1 n n k=0 k n m ? 1/(m + 2) 1/(m + 1) = m + 1 m + 2. Laplace designed and solved this problem for philosophical reasons. He used it to argue that the sun will rise tomorrow with probability (m + 1)/(m + 2) if we know that it has risen in the m preceding days. Therefore, according to this, as time passes by, the probability that the sun rises again becomes higher, and the event of the sun
rising becomes more and more certain day after day. It is clear that, to argue this
way, we should accept the problematic assumption that the phenomenon of the sun
rising is “random,” and the model of this problem is identical to its random behavior"

,,4.4,Expectations of Discrete Random Variables,Exercise A,1EA,"There is a story about Charles Dickens (1812–1870), the English novelist and one of the most popular writers in the history of literature. It is known that Dickens was interested in practical applications of mathematics. On the final day in March during a year in the second half of the nineteenth century, he was scheduled to leave London by train and travel about an hour to visit a very good friend. However, Mr. Dickens was aware of the fact that in England there were, on the average, two serious train accidents each month. Knowing that there had been only one serious accident so far during the month of March, Dickens thought that the probability of a serious train accident on the last day of March would be very high. Thus he called his friend and postponed his visit until the next day. He boarded the train on April 1, feeling much safer and believing that he had used his knowledge of mathematics correctly by leaving the next day. He did arrive safely! Is there a fallacy in Dickens, argument? Explain."

The first 12 piles are arranged in a circle like the numbers on the face of a clock. The 13th pile is placed at the center of the circle. Play begins by turning over the bottom card in the center pile. If this card is a king, it is placed face up on the top of the center pile, and a new card is drawn from the bottom of this pile. If the card drawn is not a king, then (counting the jack as 11 and the queen as 12) it is placed face up on the pile located in the hour position corresponding to the number of the card. Whichever pile the card drawn is placed on, a new card is drawn from the bottom of that pile. This card is placed face up on the pile indicated (either the hour position or the center depending on whether the card is or is not a king) and the play is repeated. The game ends when the 4th king is placed on the center pile. If that occurs on the last remaining card, the player wins. The number of cards turned over until the 4th king appears determines the length of the game. Therefore, the player wins if the length of the game is 52.

Each of two persons places his wallet on the table. Whoever has the smallest amount of money in his wallet, wins all the money in the other wallet. Each of the players reason as follows: “I may lose what I have but I may also win more than I have. So the game is to my advantage.” As Kent G. Merryfield, Ngo Viet, and Saleem Watson have observed in their paper “The Wallet Paradox” in the August–September 1997 issue of the American Mathematical Monthly, Paradoxically, it seems that the game is to the advantage of both players. ... However, the inference that “the game is to my advantage” is the source of the apparent paradox, because it does not take into account the probabilities of winning or losing. In other words, if the game is played many times, how often does a player win? How often does he lose? And by how much? Following the analysis of Kent G. Merryfield, Ngo Viet, and Saleem Watson, let X and Y be the amount of money in the wallets of players A and B, respectively. Let WA and WB be the amount of money that player A and B will win, respectively. WA(X, Y ) = ?WB(X, Y ) and WA(X, Y ) = ? ?? ?? ?X if X>Y Y if X<b< ?. Show that E(WA) = E(WB)=0."
