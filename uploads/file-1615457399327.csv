,,,,,29RP,"From the set of integers  1, 2, 3,..., 100000 a number is selected at random. What is the probability that the sum of its digits is 8? Hint: Establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of integers from {1, 2,..., 100000} the sum of whose digits is 8, and the set of possible ways 8 identical objects can be placed into 5 distinguishable cells. Then use Example 2.22.",,
