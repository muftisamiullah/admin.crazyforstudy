"Financial Accounting, 8th Edition","8th Edition","9780078025556","78025559","Robert Libby, Patricia Libby, Daniel Short","Libby/Libby/Short wrote this text based on their belief that the subject of financial accounting is inherently interesting, but financial accounting textbooks are often not. They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design.

Libby/Libby/Short successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting.

Libby/Libby/Short believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries."

They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Hodge successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.

Fundamentals of Financial Accounting Concepts delivers a unique approach to building accounting skills while maintaining a more traditional use of debits and credits. Through this method, the authors drive students' curiosity and inspire them to ask the ""why"" questions that get at the heart of how Accounting works. By teaching foundational accounting concepts in a logical sequence, the Edmonds author team shifts the focus from memorizing procedures to the development of real-world thinking patterns. Author Chris Edmonds has also created a highly popular and widely used series of video lectures, which engage students by clearly and charismatically going over each learning objective in a conversational style. These videos help reinforce important lessons and are always available for review. 

Through use of the financial statements model and transactional analysis, students quickly see how any given business event affects the financial statements. By having this ""big picture"" mentality, students can tie any single transaction back to the impact on the overall business. Between the straightforward writing, popular video lectures, and unique coverage approach, Fundamentals of Financial Accounting Concepts enables students to fully comprehend the material presented as future decision-makers."

Financial accounting is undergoing a period of unprecedented change. The FASB and IASB have been working together to issue converged accounting standards that will dramatically change key reporting areas, and more generally have sought to converge accounting standards over time. However, at present the convergence process appears to have stalled with respect to new standards, and it is not clear when, if ever, IFRS will be fully incorporated into U.S. GAAP.

"FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 9TH","16th Edition","9781308821672","1259222136","Libby","Libby/Libby/Hodge wrote this text based on their belief that the subject of financial accounting is inherently interesting, but financial accounting textbooks are often not. They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Hodge successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.

"GEN COMBO LOOSELEAF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONNECT ACCESS CARD","9th Edition","9781259912313","1259912310","Robert Libby, Patricia Libby, Frank Hodge Ch","Libby/Libby/Hodge wrote this text based on their belief that the subject of financial accounting is inherently interesting, but financial accounting textbooks are often not. They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Hodge successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. 
The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't.
By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries."
"Fundamental Financial Accounting Concepts","10th Edition","9781259918186","1259918181","Thomas P Edmonds, Christopher Edmonds, Frances M McNair, Philip R Olds","Students are often overwhelmed by the amount of information presented in the introductory financial accounting course, while instructors often want their students to better grasp ?the big picture.? Fundamentals of Financial Accounting Concepts delivers a unique approach to building accounting skills while maintaining a more traditional use of debits and credits. Through this method, the authors drive students? curiosity and inspire them to ask the ?why? questions that get at the heart of how Accounting works. 

By teaching foundational accounting concepts in a logical sequence, the Edmonds author team shifts the focus from memorizing procedures to the development of real-world thinking patterns. Author Chris Edmonds has also created a highly popular and widely used series of video lectures, which engage students by clearly and charismatically going over each learning objective in a conversational style. These videos help reinforce important lessons and are always available for review. 



Through use of the financial statements model and transactional analysis, students quickly see how any given business event affects the financial statements. By having this ?big picture? mentality, students can tie any single transaction back to the impact on the overall business. Between the straightforward writing, popular video lectures, and unique coverage approach, Fundamentals of Financial Accounting Concepts enables students to fully comprehend the material presented as future decision-makers."

The author team based A Contemporary Approach on the solid foundation of the Price
   14e textbook; however, in Haddock, the approach has been modified to fit the needs of a growing number of College Accounting instructors who teach the course without covering special journals. These instructors feel that special journals are an unnecessarily complicated subject for such a basic course. By eliminating special journal coverage, professors are free to focus on recording to the general journal and posting to the general ledger - the basic bookkeeping functions that are so important to accountants in the real world. Competing books have placed special journals in an appendix (Slater) or tried to separate special journal coverage from general journal coverage but retain both (McQuaig). 

Haddock is the only text on the market that eliminates special journal coverage completely (why make students pay for material they will not learn in the course?). With Haddock on the roster, instructor's have a choice between a traditional approach that fully integrates special journals into the text in a succinct and logical way (Price 14e) or a contemporary approach that focuses on the basics and is more in keeping with where the course is headed in the future (Haddock 3e)."

America is an urban nation, yet cities get a bad rap: they're dirty, poor, unhealthy, environmentally unfriendly . . . or are they? In this revelatory book, Edward Glaeser, a leading urban economist, declares that cities are actually the healthiest, greenest, and richest (in both cultural and economic terms) places to live. He travels through history and around the globe to reveal the hidden workings of cities and how they bring out the best in humankind. Using intrepid reportage, keen analysis, and cogent argument, Glaeser makes an urgent, eloquent case for the city's importance and splendor, offering inspiring proof that the city is humanity's greatest creation and our best hope for the future."

"Tastes of Paradise: A Social History of Spices, Stimulants, and Intoxicants","1st Edition","9780679744382","067974438X","Wolfgang Schivelbusch, David Jacobson","It began with pepper and other spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg, some eight hundred years ago. Then came coffee, tea, and chocolate, followed by alcohol and opium--all articles of pleasure people in the Western world craved in order to escape from their humdrum lives and heighten their daily enjoyment. How humanity transformed its history in the course of finding the rare condiments, stimulants, intoxicants, and narcotics that helped to make life more tolerable is the story of this rich and captivating book. Wolfgang Schivelbusch, in his engrossing journey through the centuries, documents with a wealth of startling information (and 125 illustrations) how our drive for the pleasure substances we can eat, drink, or inhale fueled the energies of the Old World with an explosive power that propelled mankind across the oceans and into a new age. The urge to please the palate and stimulate, benumb, or pleasure the senses arose at the dawn of the modern age to dovetail with the needs of the rising merchant class and the capitalism it spawned. How the hunger for spices mobilized the Occident's energies with an intensity matched only by today's greed for oil; how coffee became the drink of the bourgeois age as the beverage which, unlike alcohol, promotes clear thinking and hard work; how tobacco became coffee's ally in fine-tuning the fast-paced nervous sensibilities of the modern era--here is a rich human array, an anecdotal history of ideas and beliefs, of fashions, fads, and rituals that orders a treasury of unknown facts in a new way to give us a fresh perspective on our own past and on our present."

A case-study approach that enables students to identify key signs of fraud in financial statements Over the last two decades, financial statement fraud has become an increasingly serious issue, resulting in the collapse of ostensibly solid companies and a subsequent lack of confidence in financial markets.

The text provides students a thorough overview of the most frequently used methods of overstating earnings and assets or understating debt in financial statements. It also provides detailed coverage of the main signals indicating possible fictitious reporting in financial statements to help students learn what to look for. And because breakdowns in ethics underlie accounting fraud, the text presents three major theories of ethics, plus applicable ethical decision-making models as well as opportunities for students to apply ethical models to real-world situations. This text provides a better teaching and learning experience-for you and your students. It will help you to: * Explain accounting fraud through detailed case studies: The text's real-world case study approach helps students understand the methods used to perpetrate financial statement fraud today. * Focus student attention on ethics: Ethics coverage integrated throughout the text helps students understand this topic's importance vis-a-vis accounting fraud. * Foster thorough understanding via student-focused features: An engaging, captivating writing style and diverse end-of-chapter materials motivate and assist students."

Introductory Financial Accounting for Business is an innovative approach that emphasizes critical thinking over the rote memorization of terms, such as debits and credits. The sequential learning model employed by the authors helps students see the bottom-line consequences of financial statements as it relates to the overall business, better preparing them for careers as accountants, entrepreneurs, and decision-makers. The authors focus initially on conceptual underpinnings -- the reasons why we approach procedures the way we do - rather than confusing students by front-loading the material with over-complicated details. Author Chris Edmonds has also created a highly popular and widely used series of video lectures, which engage students by clearly and charismatically going over each learning objective in a conversational style. These videos help reinforce important lessons and are always available for review. By developing this stronger foundation, students understand Accounting ideas more broadly and are able to ultimately learn procedural applications more quickly and accurately. With a straightforward writing style and highly engaging video lectures, this dynamic author team leads students down a streamlined learning path focused on critical thinking, clarity of concept, and applicability of material to the real world."

The Noreen solution presents integrated and proven solutions designed to help attain course goals of student readiness, comprehension of content, and application of key concepts in the managerial accounting course, while addressing the needs of instructors who do not wish to teach the financial accounting-oriented content that is included in the Garrison solution. Of the three programs in the Garrison franchise (the Brewer solution, the Garrison solution, and the Noreen solution), the Noreen solution is the most pure management accounting content. The other two programs contain greater coverage of financial accounting topics. Managerial Accounting for Managers 3e is geared towards professors who love Garrison s market-leading managerial accounting content but prefer to approach their course by eliminating the debits and credits coverage. The Noreen solution includes the managerial accounting topics such as Relevant Costs for Decision Making, Capital Budgeting Decisions, and Segment Reporting and Decentralization, however, the job-order costing chapter has been extensively rewritten to remove all journal entries. Furthermore, the chapters dealing with process costing, the statement of cash flows, and financial statement analysis have been dropped to enable professors to focus their attention on the bedrocks of managerial accounting planning, control, and decision making. McGraw-Hill s Connect Accounting offers a complete digital solution combines all the great features of Connect Accounting, along with access to an online version of Managerial Accounting for Managers 3e, so that students can easily refer back to the text for review and guidance. This media rich eBook links directly to tutorials and online resources and offers additional functionality like taking notes and highlighting key passages for reviewing later.

The FASB and IASB have been working together to issue converged accounting standards that will dramatically change key reporting areas, and more generally have sought to converge accounting standards over time.

They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Hodge successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.

"Loose Leaf For Financial Accounting","9th Edition","9781259738722","1259738728","Libby, Robert; Libby, Patricia; Hodge Ch, Frank","Libby/Libby/Hodge wrote this text based on their belief that the subject of financial accounting is inherently interesting, but financial accounting textbooks are often not. They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered career relevance as their guide when selecting material, and the need to engage the student as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. Libby/Libby/Hodge successfully implements a real-world, single focus company approach in every chapter. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. 

The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. Libby/Libby/Hodge believes in the building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. 

By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries."

From simple programs such as UBS and MYOB to complex enterprise-level systems, accounting systems play a critical function in maintaining accounting data and administering internal controls in any organization. Any aspiring accountant must fully grasp how information systems work, what their capabilities are, and their incorporation into a company's business processes and internal controls.

Using simple process maps, document flowcharts, and data flow diagrams, this comprehensive yet easily comprehended book defines business processes and explains the foundational concepts of accounting information systems (AIS). It goes on to give you a solid understanding of:
* The proper control environment for overseeing and controlling processes
* Ethics and fraud prevention, corporate and IT governance, and auditing procedures, including the COSO framework and the Trust Principles
* Business processes--from revenue and cash collection to expenditure and administrative--and the internal controls in organizations

Herman Manufacturing has been having many difficulties. This company manufactures caps and gowns used for graduation ceremonies in both high schools and colleges. Most of the company?s problems have revolved around its inability to generate sufficient sales to maintain overall profitability. The president of the company, Barbara Novel, feels that this situation has been caused by poor relations between the company and its customers. Barbara has confided in some of the company?s major customers about this matter, and they have advised her that they are very happy with the quality of the company?s products. However, they mentioned a number of problems. Among the problems given were late deliveries and incomplete orders. Further discussion with some of the company?s production employees has revealed that a wide range of production problems exist, including (i) low-quality raw materials, (ii) bottlenecks in production due to a general lack of coordination in job scheduling, and (iii) mix-ups in customer?s orders.

It may also be used as a review text in second or subsequent courses in this area. A primary objective in writing the seventh edition of the text was to present AIS material that would make students more marketable in today's accounting environment. Recognizing that over 90 percent of accounting systems are licensed rather than internally custom developed and that the current market demand is for accounting graduates who can install, operate, and audit such systems, this text represents a new paradigm. In contrast to traditional accounting systems textbooks that assume an organization will develop its own accounting system and, therefore, emphasize systems development, this textbook gives students the theoretical foundation and skills they will need to conduct a requirements analysis, search for a commercial solution, and successfully implement the software package selected. 

In addition to learning the essential AIS concepts, you will see much discussion and many examples of commercial accounting systems software as it is designed and as it should be designed. Another objective in writing this edition was to make the material student friendly. Therefore, the authors took great care in directing their words to the students. Recognizing that this is their first introduction to accounting systems, clear definitions of terms were included and numerous examples and illustrations were incorporated to explain the material. The book consists of fifteen chapters. 

The first fourteen chapters provide the theoretical and practical foundation for the final chapter on selecting and implementing AIS software. The learning experience will be optimized if all fifteen chapters are covered."

And, most importantly, the risk assessment chapter was restructured to incorporate the exacting risk assessment process as outlined in the new PCAOB risk standards.

By eliminating special journal coverage, professors are free to focus on recording to the general journal and posting to the general ledger - the basic bookkeeping functions that are so important to accountants in the real world.

With Haddock on the roster, instructor?s have a choice between a traditional approach that fully integrates special journals into the text in a succinct and logical way (Price 12e) or a contemporary approach that focuses on the basics and is more in keeping with where the course is headed in the future (Haddock 1e)."

A case-study approach that enables students to identify key signs of fraud in financial statements

Over the last two decades, financial statement fraud has become an increasingly serious issue, resulting in the collapse of ostensibly solid companies and a subsequent lack of confidence in financial markets. Detecting Accounting Fraud: Analysis and Ethics was created in response to the challenges facing accountants in this era.

The text provides students a thorough overview of the most frequently used methods of overstating earnings and assets or understating debt in financial statements. It also provides detailed coverage of the main signals indicating possible fictitious reporting in financial statements to help students learn what to look for. And because breakdowns in ethics underlie accounting fraud, the text presents three major theories of ethics, plus applicable ethical decision-making models as well as opportunities for students to apply ethical models to real-world situations.

This text provides a better teaching and learning experience?for you and your students. It will help you to:

? Explain accounting fraud through detailed case studies: The text?s real-world case study approach helps students understand the methods used to perpetrate financial statement fraud today.
? Focus student attention on ethics: Ethics coverage integrated throughout the text helps students understand this topic?s importance vis-?-vis accounting fraud.

The text is accessible to students through straightforward writing and the use of engaging, relevant real-world examples, illustrations, and analogies. The text explicitly encourages students to think through fundamental concepts and to avoid trying to learn auditing through rote memorization.

This is followed by a discussion of audit planning, the assessment of control risk, and a discussion of the nature, timing, and extent of evidence necessary to reach the appropriate level of detection risk. These concepts are then applied to each major business process and related account balances using a risk-based approach.

In covering these important concepts and their applications, the book focuses on critical judgments and decision-making processes followed by auditors.

Emphasizing the interpretation as opposed to the construction of accounting information, Accounting for Managers encourages a critical rather than unthinking acceptance of accounting techniques.  Whilst accounting information is immensely valuable for planning, decision making and control, users need to recognize the assumptions behind, and the limitations of, particular accounting techniques.

As in the previous editions, Accounting for Managers combines theory with practical examples and contemporary case studies drawn from real business situations across a wide range of manufacturing, retail and service industries."

"Introductory Relational Database Design for Business, with Microsoft Access","1st Edition","9781119329428","1119329426","Eckstein, Jonathan; Schultz, Bonnie R.","A hands-on beginner’s guide to designing relational databases and managing data using Microsoft Access Relational databases represent one of the most enduring and pervasive forms of information technology. Yet most texts covering relational database design assume an extensive, sophisticated computer science background. There are texts on relational database software tools like Microsoft Access that assume less background, but they focus primarily on details of the user interface, with inadequate coverage of the underlying design issues of how to structure databases. Growing out of Professor Jonathan Eckstein’s twenty years’ experience teaching courses on management information systems (MIS) at Rutgers Business School, this book fills this gap in the literature by providing a rigorous introduction to relational databases for readers without prior computer science or programming experience. Relational Database Design for Business, with Microsoft Access helps readers to quickly develop a thorough, practical understanding of relational database design. It takes a step-by-step, real-world approach, using application examples from business and finance every step the way. As a result, readers learn to think concretely about database design and how to address issues that commonly arise when developing and manipulating relational databases. By the time they finish the final chapter, students will have the knowledge and skills needed to build relational databases with dozens of tables. They will also be able to build complete Microsoft Access applications around such databases. ? This text: Takes a hands-on approach using numerous real-world examples drawn from the worlds of business, finance, and more Gets readers up and running, fast, with the skills they need to use and develop relational databases with Microsoft Access Moves swiftly from conceptual fundamentals to advanced design techniques Leads readers step-by-step through data management and design, relational database theory, multiple tables and the possible relationships between them, Microsoft Access features such as forms and navigation, formulating queries in SQL, and normalization? Introductory Relational Database Design for Business, with MicrosoftAccess is the definitive guide for undergraduate and graduate students in business, finance, and data analysis without prior experience in database design. While Microsoft Access is its primary “hands-on” learning vehicle, most of the skills in this text are transferrable to other relational database software such as MySQL. "
